            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            <h4>Lonely Planet</h4>

            <p>This popular travel guide site uses two different alignments. For the top of the site, the brand logo,
                title, and search bar are aligned to the —Åenter. Such a center alignment is ideal for such a short piece
                of text placed in the background of the photo at the start of the page. All other text below the
                headline and large photo is aligned to the left. As the visitor views the page's content, scrolling down
                the page, left-aligning the text makes it easier to read the columns of text as presented on this page.

            <h3>Repetition</h3>
            <h4>Lexus</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.lexus.com/" target="_blank">lexus.com</a></p>

            </picture>
            <p>The official website of a famous premium car brand uses a repetition of the same sans serif font with
                capital letters for words in the text, as well as a repetition of the font color and the same shapes of
                some design elements. The two action buttons below the advertised sales vehicle have the same rectangle
                shape and color. Three icons with their description text located just below have the same gray color and
                font size of the text and are located on the same horizontal line. This consistency in design forms a
                visually organized look of the page and gives a unique design inherent only to this website of the car
                brand.</p>

            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <h4>AT&T</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank">att.com</a></p>
            <picture><img class="image-3" src="images/Screenshot-2021-05-01-141038.png"
                    alt="Mobile version of the AT&T website."></picture>
            <p>One example of the use of contrast on this site of the American multinational telecommunications
                conglomerate is the combination of dark and light colors. The top of the page has dark colored text
                placed on a light background. Further, after the light part of the page, its dark part follows, where,
                on the contrary, the light text fits on a dark background. This use of contrast helps the reader to
                separate two texts with different content and also to highlight each of the texts in its own way. The
                blue action button combined with such a light dark background adds even more contrast to the page
                design. </p>
